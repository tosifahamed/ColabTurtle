Turtle for Google Colab notebooks
===================

Installation for Google Colab:
----
Create an empty code cell and type:

    !pip3 install git+https://github.com/tosifahamed/ColabTurtle.git

Run the code cell.


Usage
----
In any code cell, import like following:

    from ColabTurtle.Turtle import *

As Colab stores the declared variables in the runtime, call this before using: 

    initializeTurtle()

Have fun drawing!
